<h2 align="center">Hi, my name is Yasin Aksu 👋</h2> 

In software projects, I typically work in a backend position (.Net, Java), but I also have experience working on frontend projects (Angular). As a software crafter passionate about software architecture and javascript, I enjoy writing clean code and learning new technologies.
